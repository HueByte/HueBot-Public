# ` 👾 About`
HueBot public main repository.
Bot written in .net core 
Current website for project: [link](https://huebyte.github.io/Bot).
Decided to make it open source as I probably won't continue developing this bot anymore. I think it was an interesting project and with gained experience I will make another bot.
